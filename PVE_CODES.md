# Performance Vulnerability Encyclopedia (PVE) Codes

This document contains detailed descriptions of all performance issues detected by aiBsCleaner.

## Loop Performance Issues (PVE-000 to PVE-019)

### PVE-000: Nested Loop
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Category**: Loop Performance

Deeply nested loops create exponential time complexity, severely impacting performance.

**Problem**:
- Each additional nesting level multiplies execution time
- O(n²), O(n³), or worse time complexity
- CPU cache misses increase with depth

**Solution**:
- Restructure algorithm to reduce nesting
- Use early breaks/continues to minimize iterations
- Consider lookup tables or different data structures

---

### PVE-001: Memory Allocation In Loop
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Category**: Memory Performance

Memory allocations inside loops cause repeated heap allocations and GC pressure.

**Problem**:
- Each allocation triggers heap operations (~100-500ns)
- Increases GC pressure and pause times
- Memory fragmentation over time

**Solution**:
- Pre-allocate memory before the loop
- Reuse existing allocations
- Use object pools for expensive objects

---

### PVE-002: Append In Loop
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Category**: Slice Performance

Using append() in loops without proper capacity causes repeated memory reallocations.

**Problem**:
- Slice capacity doubles each reallocation: 1→2→4→8→16...
- Previous data must be copied to new backing array
- O(n) copy operations for n appends = O(n²) total

**Solution**:
- Pre-allocate slice with `make([]T, 0, expectedCapacity)`
- Use capacity based on known or estimated size
- Consider using alternative data structures

---

### PVE-003: Defer In Loop
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Category**: Loop Performance

Defer statements in loops accumulate and execute at function end, causing memory buildup.

**Problem**:
- Each defer allocates stack space (~30-50 bytes)
- All defers execute at function end, not loop iteration end
- Can cause stack overflow with many iterations

**Solution**:
- Move cleanup outside the loop
- Use manual cleanup within loop iterations
- Restructure code to avoid defer in loops

---

## Memory & GC Issues (PVE-020 to PVE-039)

### PVE-020: Memory Leak
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Category**: Memory Management

Detected potential memory leak through unfreed resources or references.

**Problem**:
- Memory usage grows over time
- Can lead to out-of-memory errors
- Reduced application performance

**Solution**:
- Ensure proper resource cleanup
- Use weak references where appropriate
- Profile memory usage regularly

---

### PVE-021: Global Variable
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Category**: Memory Management

Excessive use of global variables increases memory pressure and complicates testing.

**Problem**:
- Global variables are never garbage collected
- Creates hidden dependencies
- Makes testing and concurrency harder

**Solution**:
- Use dependency injection
- Limit globals to configuration only
- Consider struct-based approaches

---

## Slice Performance Issues (PVE-040 to PVE-049)

### PVE-040: Slice Capacity
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Category**: Slice Performance

Slice created without appropriate capacity hint, causing unnecessary reallocations.

**Problem**:
- Default capacity of 0 causes multiple reallocations
- Each reallocation doubles capacity: 0→1→2→4→8...
- Memory copying overhead increases linearly

**Solution**:
- Use `make([]T, 0, expectedSize)` when size is known
- Estimate capacity based on typical usage
- Monitor actual usage patterns

---

## String Performance Issues (PVE-060 to PVE-069)

### PVE-060: String Concatenation
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Category**: String Performance

String concatenation in loops or multiple operations creates numerous temporary strings.

**Problem**:
- Each + operation creates a new string
- O(n²) time complexity for n concatenations
- Excessive garbage collection

**Solution**:
- Use `strings.Builder` for multiple concatenations
- Use `fmt.Sprintf` for formatted strings
- Pre-size Builder with `Grow()` if size is known

---

## Defer Optimization Issues (PVE-070 to PVE-079)

### PVE-070: Defer Overhead
**Severity**: LOW to MEDIUM  
**Category**: Defer Performance

Unnecessary defer usage adds overhead without significant benefit.

**Problem**:
- Each defer adds ~30ns overhead
- Stack space allocation for defer args
- Not needed for simple operations

**Solution**:
- Call cleanup functions directly when appropriate
- Reserve defer for complex cleanup scenarios
- Use defer only when multiple exit paths exist

---

## Concurrency Issues (PVE-080 to PVE-109)

### PVE-080: Race Condition
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Category**: Concurrency

Detected potential race condition in concurrent access to shared data.

**Problem**:
- Data corruption from simultaneous access
- Unpredictable program behavior
- Hard to reproduce bugs

**Solution**:
- Use mutex or sync.RWMutex for shared data
- Use channels for goroutine communication
- Apply atomic operations for simple data types

---

### PVE-088: Channel Deadlock
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Category**: Channel Performance

Potential deadlock detected in channel operations.

**Problem**:
- Goroutines waiting indefinitely
- Application hangs or freezes
- Resource exhaustion

**Solution**:
- Use buffered channels when appropriate
- Implement proper select statements with timeouts
- Ensure balanced producers and consumers

---

## HTTP & Network Issues (PVE-110 to PVE-129)

### PVE-110: HTTP No Timeout
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Category**: Network Performance

HTTP client operations without timeout can hang indefinitely.

**Problem**:
- Blocked requests consume goroutines
- Resource exhaustion under load
- Poor user experience

**Solution**:
- Always set reasonable timeouts
- Use context.WithTimeout for request-specific timeouts
- Configure both connection and request timeouts

---

## Database Issues (PVE-130 to PVE-139)

### PVE-130: No Prepared Statement
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Category**: Database Performance

SQL queries executed without prepared statements lose optimization benefits.

**Problem**:
- Query parsing overhead on each execution
- No protection against SQL injection
- Database cannot optimize query plan

**Solution**:
- Use prepared statements for repeated queries
- Implement proper parameter binding
- Cache prepared statements when possible
